            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81%
                for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017â€“18,
                84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53%
                and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.India's improved education system is often cited as
                one of the main contributors to its economic development.Much of the progress, especially in higher
                education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in
                higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) of
                26.3% in 2019,[8] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education
                enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to
                continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated
                in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any
                accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation
                of government schools and private schools can be misleading.
                In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.In India's higher education
                system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In
                universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a
                maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary.
                Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India.</p>
